1. Choose between **DGE filtered** and a **Custom** gene list. The number of genes to be included in gene set enrichment analysis, based on your chosen parameters, will be displayed.

    **DGE filtered**
    
    a. Select a contrast between two clusters.

    b. Choose whether to include all differentially expressed (DE) genes or only those that are up in one cluster or another.

    c. Choose the number of top DE genes to include. Check **Use all genes passing filters** to include all DE genes, based on your chosen parameters, that meet the detection rate threshold chosen on the initial load page and a 5% false discovery rate.

    **Custom**  
    Paste a comma- or space-delimited list of genes in the **Paste genes** box.

2. Choose 1 or more enrichR libraries or accept the default selections.

3. Click **Run GSE**.
