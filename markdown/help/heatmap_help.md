1. Choose between **DGE filtered** and a **Custom** gene list. **DGE filtered** will be available once you have run DGE on the **Run DGE** sub-tab. The number of genes and samples to be included in the heatmap, based on your chosen parameters, will be displayed.

    **DGE filtered**
    
      a. Select a contrast if your experimental design contains multiple contrasts.

      b. Choose whether to include all differentially expressed (DE) genes or only those that are up or down in a particular experimental group.

      c. Choose the number of top DE genes to include. Check **Use all genes passing filters** to include all genes, based on your chosen parameters, that meet the statistical thresholds chosen on the **Run DGE** sub-tab.

    **Custom**  
    Paste a comma- or space-delimited list of genes in the **Paste genes** box.

2. Choose a color palette.

3. Select one or more factors to concatenate together as group labels for samples.

4. Choose whether to cluster the genes and/or samples.

5. The heatmap will show all samples by default. To show only samples from the chosen contrast (when **DGE filtered** is chosen as the gene list), select **Use samples from contrast only**.

6. Click **Build heatmap**.

    Click on any gene (row) in the heatmap to view a more detailed plot below the heatmap.
