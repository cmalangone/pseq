This page enables differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between groups of cells from chosen factors in the metadata.

1. Select a factor variable and two groups to compare. 

    To compare one group vs. all other cells, choose 'All' in **Group 2**.

    Optional parameters for running DGE can be set by clicking **View options**. See the tutorial or Seurat R package documentation for details on these options.

    To reset the optional parameters to defaults, click **Reset defaults**.

2. Click **Submit**.

Tables of DGE results from all comparisons run can be viewed and downloaded below in the **DGE results** section. Each factor and comparison for which DGE has been run can be selected.

To clear all DGE results, click **Clear results**.
