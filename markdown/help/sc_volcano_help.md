Differentially expressed (DE) genes between two chosen clusters or sets of cells are visualized using three volcano plot types and a table of results for the chosen comparison.

#### **Plot type**
  Choose from 3 plot types:

* **Gene expression ratio**
    
* **Detection rate difference**
    
* **Gene expression difference**

#### **Label**
Choose whether the top DE genes labeled on the plot are to be chosen based on the largest fold-changes or the smallest p-values.

#### **Cluster A** and **Cluster B**
The two clusters or sets of cells to be compared.

Click **Download stats** under **Cluster A** or **Cluster B** to download DGE results for the chosen cluster or set of cells.

#### **# top genes to label**
The number of top DE genes to label on the plot.

#### **Differential gene expression table**
Use **Abs. log2 fold-change** and **Adj. p-value** to include only genes that meet these thresholds, and click **Load table** to view the results.
