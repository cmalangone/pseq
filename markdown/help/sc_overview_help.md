**Overview** enables visualization and exploration of clustering and metadata.

### **Cluster exploration**

#### **Cluster separation**
Cluster quality at different resolutions (and thus number of clusters) is visualized using three metrics of cluster separation. For the first and second option, you may choose a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. The currently chosen resolution is hightlighted in red in each plot.

1. **# positive DEGs per cluster to nearest cluster**
2. **# positive DEGs per cluster to all other clusters**
3. **Silhouette widths**

#### **Silhouette plot**
Silhouette widths for each cell, grouped by cluster, are plotted for the currently chosen resolution.

### **Metadata exploration**

#### **Metadata relationships**
Numeric metadata variables are plotted against each other.

#### **Metadata by cluster**
Metadata variables are plotted against clusters at the currently chosen resolution. 

Numeric variables are plotted as boxplots, and factor variables are plotted as stacked barplots.
