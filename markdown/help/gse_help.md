1. Choose between **DGE filtered** and a **Custom** gene list. **DGE filtered** will be available once you have run DGE on the **Run DGE** sub-tab. The number of genes to be included in gene set enrichment analysis, based on your chosen parameters, will be displayed.

    **DGE filtered**
    a. Select a contrast if your experimental design contains multiple contrasts.

    b. Choose whether to include all differentially expressed (DE) genes or only those that are up or down in a particular experimental group.

    c. Choose the number of top DE genes to include. Check **Use all genes passing filters** to include all genes, based on your chosen parameters, that meet the statistical thresholds chosen on the **Run DGE** sub-tab.

    **Custom**  
    Paste a comma- or space-delimited list of genes in the **Paste genes** box.

2. Choose 1 or more enrichR libraries or accept the default selections.

3. Click **Run GSE**.
