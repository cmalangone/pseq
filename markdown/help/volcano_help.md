This page visualizes differential gene expression results as a volcano plot or MA plot and a table.

Choose between a volcano plot and MA plot.

Choose a contrast if your experiemental design contains multiple contrasts.

You may hover over points in the plot to view DGE details.

In the DGE table at the bottom, you may click one or more rows to highlight the corresponding gene(s) in the plot.
