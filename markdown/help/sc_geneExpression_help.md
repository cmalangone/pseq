### **Gene expression by cluster**

Expression of individual genes by clusters at the currently selected resolution is visualized as boxplots with a dendrogram on the **By cluster** sub-tab. 

The left vertical axis is the normalized **ln(expression)** of a gene. 

The dendrogram reflects similarities among clusters based on all genes.

If **Include jitter** is selected, individual data points are plotted.

If **Include detection rate** is selected, the gene detection rate per cluster, or % of cells per cluster expressing the gene, is shown as dashes along with each boxplot.

### **Cell distribution of genes of interest**
Expression of individual genes is displayed according to a color scale on a dimensional reduction plot (either PCA, UMAP, or tSNE) on the **Cell distribution** sub-tab.

Select a gene, cell embedding (i.e., PCA, UMAP, or tSNE), and which variable to display on the x- and y-axis.

Under **Plot**, choose **Gene expression overlay** to overlay the normalized expression of the selected gene on cells according to a color scale, or choose **Clusters** to overlay cluster labels on the plot.

Check **Include cluster labels (style as above)** to include cluster labels on the plot or un-check to hide them.
