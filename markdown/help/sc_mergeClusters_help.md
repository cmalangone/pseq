This section enables you to merge multiple clusters together based on the currently selected resolution and save the new clusters for future analysis.

Select clusters to combine and view the plot of the number cells per cluster as guidance.

Provide a username, a short comment if desired, and give the updated table a name or accept the default name. 

Click **Save to database** to save the new clusters. The next time you select the same dataset on the initial load page, the updated table will be available to use in place of the default metadata table.
